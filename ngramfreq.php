      <h2>N-gram Frequency Correction.</h2>
      <p align="left">Titles consisting of words or phrases that are exceedingly common in the English language corpus (such as Stephen King's <i>It</i> or Joyce Carol Oates's <i>them</i>) tend to be overrepresented in search results, thus resulting in an articially inflated citation count. To counteract this tendency, Metacanon adjusts the scores for these works accordingly. Scores subjected to n-gram frequency correction are estimates only and are marked with an asterisk. N-gram freqencies are drawn from the <a href="http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/" target="_blank"> Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>, a project created by <a href="http://davies-linguistics.byu.edu/personal/" target="_blank">Mark Davies.</a></p>

      <h2>Non-unique author Correction.</h2>
      <p align="left">Books by authors with a non-unique name (for example "Winston Churchill," the American novelist) tend to be overrepresented in search results, thus resulting in an articially inflated citation count. To counteract this tendency, Metacanon adjusts the scores for these works accordingly. Scores subjected to non-unique author correction are estimates only and are marked with a dagger.</p>
